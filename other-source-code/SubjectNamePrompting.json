Here's where I placed each one:\n\n1. Under \"Number Operations\":\n   - \"place value\" → Basic Operations\n   - \"rounding to the nearest whole (10, 100, etc)\" → Decimals\n   - \"rounding to significant figures\" → Decimals\n   - \"converting between decimals and percentages\" → Decimals\n   - \"factors and highest common factor\" → New subcategory \"Factors and Multiples\"\n   - \"multiples and lowest common multiple\" → New subcategory \"Factors and Multiples\"\n   - \"types, naming and estimating\" → New subcategory \"Estimation\"\n   - \"estimation\" → New subcategory \"Estimation\"\n   - \"brackets, indices, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction\" → Basic Operations\n   - \"percentage increase and decrease\" → New subcategory \"Percentages\"\n\n2. Under \"Algebra\":\n   - \"function machines\" → Basic Algebra\n   - \"trial and improvement and iterative methods\" → Equations\n\n3. Under \"Functions and Graphs\":\n   - \"real life graphs\" → Non-Linear Functions\n   - \"other graphs-others\" → Non-Linear Functions\n\n4. Under \"Geometry\":\n   - \"construct triangle\" → 2D Shapes\n\nThe structure remains the same, but I've added a few new subcategories under \"Number Operations\" to better organize related topics. All topics should now be properly categorized. Would you like me to make any adjustments to these categorizations?"
