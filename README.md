# Kaggle: Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics  

This project explores the Kaggle competition “Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Maths”, which focuses on predicting student misconceptions in mathematics using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The task involves analyzing multiple-choice diagnostic questions, where each incorrect option corresponds to a specific misconception. Our team approached the problem through both data exploration and model development, combining statistical analysis with machine learning techniques.

## About the competition 

### Background

Eedi is an educational platform where learners answer Diagnostic Questions.

- Each question has 4 answer options: 1 correct and 3 incorrect.
- Each incorrect answer corresponds to a specific misconception.

### Objective

The task is to build an NLP model capable of predicting misconceptions and incorrect answers in math multiple-choice questions.

## Methodology

Our approach consisted of two main parallel tasks:

1. Data Exploration

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied statistical methods and data visualization
- Identified trends, patterns, and challenges in the dataset

2. Model Development
- Built and tested machine learning/NLP models for misconception prediction
- Submitted models to Kaggle for performance evaluation
- Drew inspiration from both team members’ experience and community approaches used in the competition

## Project Outcomes
- Conducted statistical analysis on queries and semantic clustering using Claude API 
- Built 2 stage ML pipeline with Information Retrivial and Re-ranking
